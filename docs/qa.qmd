# ``Q&A``

## Where can 'brdr' be used for?

- Short answer: All kinds of Geodata quality assurance: validation, correction, alignment, actualization, (auto-)updates, ...
- Long answer: 
    * Geodata-management:
        * Implementation of ``brdr`` in business-processes and tooling
        * Bulk geodata-alignment
        * Alignment after reprojection of data
        * Cleaning data: In a postprocessing-phase, the algorithm executes sliver-cleanup and validity-cleaning on the
          resulting geometries
        * ...
    * Data-Analysis: Investigate the pattern in deviation and change between thematic and reference boundaries
    * Update-detection: Investigate the descriptive formula before and after alignment to check for (automatic)
      alignment of geodata

## Does 'brdr' support multiple coordinate systems (CRS)?

- Short answer: Yes
- Long answer: Yes it does. When creating a aligner you can define the crs you want to use. This has to be a projected coordinate system with units in **meter**. When loading data, you have to provide the data in this CRS. When on-the-fly dataloaders are used, they will try to download the data in the provided crs if available. if not available, an error is returned.

## Which geometry types are supported?

- Short answer: (Multi-)Points, (Multi-)LineStrings, and (Multi-)Polygons.
- Long answer: **brdr** was initially started to align thematic (Multi-)Polygons to reference (Multi-)Polygons. Afterwards processors are added to also support (multi-)linestrings and (multi-)Points.

## Does 'brdr' support 3D geometries ( & M/Z-coordinates)?

- Short answer: No, it is currently 2D-only. (3D and M-Z values are not supported)
- Long answer: The library is optimized for 2D alignment. If you provide geometries with M- or Z-coordinates, the alignment will be calculated based on the $X$ and $Y$ planes. M/Z-values are stripped.

## Is topology preserved between the thematic geometries (input) ?

- Short answer: No, but...
- Long answer: Every thematic input geometry is processed individually to find a result/prediction. So there is no topology preserved between multiple thematic input geometries. However there is a TopologyGeometryProcessor (experimental) that searches for predictions for every thematic geometry, while trying to preserve topology between these geometries.
