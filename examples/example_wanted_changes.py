# example to test if we can separate wanted deviations from unwanted deviations.
# By calculating results with a series of relevant distances we get a graphic.
# There is a difference in the graphic for wanted and unwanted deviations:
#   *unwanted deviations: will evaluate more gradually
#   *wanted deviations: have a harder breakpoint
# The type of breakpoint, breakpoint-distance and length between breakpoints can give
# an indication of wanted and unwanted deviations

# TODO: future possibilities to detect the 'wanted' breakpoint automatically? (
#  AI-machine learning?)
