# parcel change detection:
# * it can be used to do a first alignment of the original features
#       (in this case, based on parcel version adpF2023 (1st January 2023)
# * it can be used to do a new alignment on the actual version of the parcels adp
# * it can be used to convert the geometries to a formula, to compare and
#       evaluate if equality is detected after alignement
